# Getting Started with Code-Clamp Ui

### 1. Install Essential Utilities


All components are powered by [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and use the handy `cn` utility function. Install with:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/utils.json 
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/utils.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://codesnippetui/r/utils.json
```

</Tabs>

### 2. That's it ðŸŽ‰

We use [lucide-icons](https://lucide.dev/guide/installation) for most components that include icons, along with some [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. These dependencies will be automatically installed when using the CLI.

For exemple to add `card-05` to your project, it will be easy as:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/card-05.json
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/card-05.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/card-05.json
```

</Tabs>

_While we provide a convenient 'copy' button for the code, we strongly recommend using the CLI for installing components, as it ensures all necessary files are included._

Add to your page and it works!

```jsx
import Card05 from "@/components/codesnippetui/card-05";

export default function Page() {
    return <Card05 />;
}
```

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

### 3. Blocks

Blocks are a set of components to make a complete blocks, they contain multiples files. To install them it is mandatory to use the `cli`. For example it you'd like to install `ai-card-generation` block:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/ai-card-generation.json
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/ai-card-generation.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/ai-card-generation.json
```

</Tabs>

Then, add to your page and it works!

```jsx
/**
 * AICardGeneration require 5 additional components
 * that will be automatically installed with the CLI.
 */
import AICardGeneration from "@/components/codesnippetui/AICardGeneration";

export default function Page() {
    return <AICardGeneration />;
}
```

### 4. Optionnal dependencies

Some components require additional libraries, listed at the bottom of each components. Make sure to install them to ensure the component works properly.

### 5. Monorepo

For monorepo `shadcn/ui` CLI contain the options `-c` to the path to your workspace for exemple:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/card-05.json -c ./apps/www
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/card-05.json -c ./apps/www
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.codesnipet.dev/r/card-05.json -c ./apps/www
```
